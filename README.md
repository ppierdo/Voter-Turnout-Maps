These maps compare demographic variables from the American Community Survey to the voter turnout rate in the November 2014 general election.
Each map compares one demographic (median age, median household income, and home ownership rate) to the turnout rate.
The turnout rate was calculated by geocoding all of the registered voters in Philadelphia County and joining them to a shapefile of Census block groups.
Then the number of voters who vote in the November 2014 election was divided into the total number of registered voters for the block group.
